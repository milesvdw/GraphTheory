\section*{Problem 1 - a}
How could we delete an arbitrary vertex v from this graph, without changing the shortest-path distance
between any other pair of vertices? Describe an algorithm that constructs a directed graph G' = (V', E') with weighted edges, where V = V $\textbackslash$\{v\}, and the shortest-path distance between any two nodes in G' is equal to the shortest-path distance between the same two nodes in G, in O($V^2$) time.

To solve this, we can replace paths that are broken by the removal of \textit{v}. For each edge pred(\textit{v})$\rightarrow$\textit{v}$\rightarrow$succ(\textit{v}), if the successor to \textit{v} is adjacent to the predecessor ov \textit{v}, then record the weight of that edge. If the total weight of edge pred(\textit{v})$\rightarrow$\textit{v}$\rightarrow$succ(\textit{v}) is less than the weight of pred(\textit{v})$\rightarrow$succ(\textit{v}), change the weight of  pred(\textit{v})$\rightarrow$succ(\textit{v}) to weight(pred(\textit{v})$\rightarrow$\textit{v}$\rightarrow$succ(\textit{v})). Then, delete \textit{v}. If, however, succ(\textit{v}) $\notin$ adj(pred(\textit{v)}), add an edge pred(\textit{v})$\rightarrow$succ(\textit{v}) with weight(pred(\textit{v})$\rightarrow$\textit{v}$\rightarrow$succ(\textit{v})). Then, delete \textit{v}. 

In this way, we preserve the shortest path from each pred(\textit{v}) to each succ(\textit{v}). 

This algorithm runs max 2V times (for each edge incoming and outgoing from \textit{v}), and for each of those 2V runs may have to replace up to 2V edges. thus, the runtime is O(4$V^2$), or O($V^2$)
